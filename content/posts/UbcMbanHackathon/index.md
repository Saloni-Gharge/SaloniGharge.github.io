## Green6Sense: AI-Driven Energy Insights  
Green6Sense is an AI-powered solution that optimizes energy consumption by detecting electricity anomalies, benchmarking building performance, and forecasting energy trends. Our platform aligns with UBC’s ambitious goal of reducing campus emissions by 85% by 2030.

## Mission  
To advance UBC’s energy efficiency goals through data-driven electricity anomaly detection, improving sustainability and reducing inefficiencies.

## Key Issues  
- High electricity usage & inefficiencies  
- Complexity in monitoring & benchmarking  
- Barriers to energy efficiency implementation

## AI-Driven Energy Insights  

### 1️. Electricity Anomaly Detection
- 10 years of historical data analyzed (2015 - 2025)
- Detected spikes in electricity usage during extreme weather events:
  - Feb 2019: Record-breaking snowfall in Vancouver  
  - Mar 2024: Power restoration after a windstorm-induced outage  
- **Unrealistic anomalies identified** in many buildings where demand surged beyond 1.5x the interquartile range (IQR) of the past decade.

### 2️. Historical & Peer Benchmarking
- Building performance benchmarked against its 3-year historical average and peer buildings of the same type.  
- Over 50% of institutional buildings at UBC have higher electricity EUI than the building type average.  
- Findings align with EUI benchmarks of Vancouver office buildings, revealing UBC buildings underperform in energy efficiency.

### 3️. Forecast & GenAI Recommendation
- Developed a 30-day electricity EUI forecast using BigQuery ML ARIMA-Plus model 
- Automated reports on energy trends and AI-driven recommendations using Vertex AI Gemini 2.0 Flash model.

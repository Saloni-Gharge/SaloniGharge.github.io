🚀 **Thrilled to share our experience from the recent Sauder MBAN Hackathon 2025, supported by Google Cloud at UBC, where our team, Green6Sense🌱, proudly secured 2nd place!** 🏆

## 🌍 About Green6Sense
Green6Sense is an AI-powered **smart energy management system** that detects anomalies, benchmarks energy efficiency, and forecasts energy consumption trends in real time. Built with cutting-edge cloud technologies, our solution aligns with **UBC's ambitious goal of reducing emissions by 85% by 2030**.

## Key Highlights
- Analyzed **10 years of UBC energy data** to identify inefficiencies.
- Developed a **30-day electricity EUI forecast** using **BigQuery ML’s ARIMA-Plus** and **Vertex AI’s Gemini 2.0 Flash** models.  
- Built an **interactive dashboard in Looker Studio** for real-time monitoring and AI-driven recommendations.  
- Benchmarked building performance—**50% of UBC buildings exceeded energy targets!**  
- Proposed action plans including **audits, anomaly detection, & automation**.

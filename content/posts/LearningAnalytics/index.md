The 2024 Learning Analytics Hackathon was an incredible opportunity to collaborate with a team of five talented peers and solve real-world education challenges using data analytics. Hosted at the UBC Sauder Learning Labs, this 10th edition hackathon focused on Canvas discussion data to enhance teaching and learning experiences.

## The Challenge  
Our 5-hour challenge was to analyze UBC Canvas discussions and uncover actionable insights to improve student engagement and instructor efficiency.

## Key Problems Identified:
- **Repetitive Questions:** Students frequently ask similar questions, making manual tracking inefficient.  
- **Instructor Efficiency:** Professors repeatedly answer the same queries, reducing valuable teaching time.

## Our AI-Powered Solution  
To address these challenges, we developed prototype with two core features:  

1️. Keyword Filter & Search: Enables users to filter discussion topics using keywords, streamlining navigation.  
2️. Suggesting Similar Discussions: Uses AI-driven similarity analysis to recommend related discussions, reducing redundancy.  

## Methodology & Approach  
We implemented data-driven AI techniques to structure and optimize discussions: 

1️. **Data Extraction & Profiling**: Retrieved Canvas discussion data via APIs.  
2️. **Text Processing & Cleansing**: Standardized data by removing noise.  
3️. **Keyword Analysis**: Applied TF-IDF & Word2Vec models to extract meaningful keywords.  
4️. **AI-Powered Similarity Matching**: Used cosine similarity to find and suggest related discussions.  

## Data Visualization  
Our findings were presented using:  
- **Keyword Similarity Scores** (via Word2Vec)
- **Heatmaps** to visualize discussion topic overlaps 

## **The Student Journey with Our System**  
- **Step 1**: Student searches for a question using keywords.  
- **Step 2**: System retrieves similar discussions or prompts for new ones.  
- **Step 3**: Problem gets resolved through past or newly created discussions.  

## **UI/UX Enhancements**  
Our intuitive interface allowed users to:  
- **Search discussions efficiently** using smart filtering.  
- **Find similar threads** before posting new queries, reducing redundant discussions.

## Future Vision: **Discussion Archive**  
To improve long-term teaching efficiency, we proposed an archival system for frequently discussed topics:  
- **Filter high-engagement discussions**
- **Rank most-repeated topics**
- **Create an instructor-approved archive**  

## Key Takeaways & Impact
- **Saved time for instructors & students** by reducing redundancy.
- **Leveraged AI & NLP** for smart content filtering.
- **Enhanced engagement** through automated insights.  

This hackathon reinforced the power of AI & data analytics in education. Excited for more innovation ahead!

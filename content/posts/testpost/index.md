## Overview  

**Quranntino** is an innovative **Indoor Positioning and Geofencing System** designed to monitor **Covid-19 patients** within hospital premises. The system utilizes **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) bands** and strategically placed **receivers** to ensure **real-time tracking** of patients. If a patient attempts to **breach the geofence** or **remove the band**, an **instant alert** is sent to hospital authorities via a **web application**.  

This solution was developed to **support frontline healthcare workers** by improving **patient monitoring, security, and resource allocation** during the pandemic.  

**Key Technologies Used:**  
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons** for tracking  
- **ESP32 microcontroller** for smart wearable bands  
- **Firebase Authentication & Real-Time Database**  
- **Dynamic Web Application** with an intuitive UI

## Why This Solution?  

### Cost-Effective Implementation  
- **BLE Receivers:** ‚Çπ365 per unit *(3 receivers = ‚Çπ1,095/-)*  
- **Wearable Band Components:**  
  - **ESP32:** ‚Çπ365  
  - **Battery:** ‚Çπ250  
  - **Touch Sensor:** ‚Çπ23  
  - **Temperature/Pulse Sensor:** ‚Çπ73  
  - **Watch Strap:** ‚Çπ20  
  - **Total per band:** ‚Çπ731/- *(For 2 bands = ‚Çπ1,462/-)*  
- **Overall cost:** ‚Çπ2,557/- *(affordable for hospitals)*  

### Low Power Consumption  
- BLE technology ensures **minimal battery drain** while maintaining high accuracy.  

### Indoor Positioning & Security  
- **More reliable than GPS** in enclosed hospital environments.  
- **Real-time alerts** for unauthorized patient movement.
